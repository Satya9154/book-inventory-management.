# book-inventory-management.
Create a web application for book inventory management. Imagine you are managing a bookstore and need to keep track of inventory (i.e.,number of copies) you have on every book. On the backend, you need to keep track of books (along with their respective ID from Google Book API) and their inventory count. When a book stock goes to zero, it is considered out of stock.
